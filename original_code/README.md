**Program description**
It is a registration system, where you select your name, as a student, to open your page, view your current
courses (if any), and to add new courses. After you add a course through the crn (which you should find
in the database), you should also type your PIN, which you will get from your professor. Once done and everything
is correct, the course will be added to the database and you will receive a confirmation page.
