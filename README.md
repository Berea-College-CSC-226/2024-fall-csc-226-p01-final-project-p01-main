## References 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

`FinanceTrack: Your Personal Budget and Finance Manager`

` This project will help users track their income, expenses, and savings to achieve financial goals.`

`chapter 2,4, W3Schools Python Guide.`


  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Don't leave me in your README!](image/crc.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one. ")



Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: nshizirungud
    Branch 2 name: Self 
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. ðŸ™ƒ

Reflect on what youâ€™ve done so far. Howâ€™s it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    So far I feel On time I feel as though I can complete this. I have previously worked on something closely related to UI and
    I feel excited to see how this project will look in the end. 
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

 `70 - 100%`

 Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    I feel confident in my ability to complete this project. I have a majority of the work finsihed for this project. The only thing left is making it look clean.
    I have my test cases and my code is working as intended. I have implemented my player vs player logic that's working smoothly. 
    Some strategies I can employ to increase the likelihood of my success would be making sure to pace myself. I don't have forever on this project but it shouldn't be something I should be dreading over. 
    If I go to fast I'll end up stressing myself and the project is going to be a hassle to deal with. If I go slow the project won''t be finsihed to the best of it's ability. So I have to pace myself just where
    I can make progress and won't feel like this project is taking a huge toll on my mental health.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm.   


When you first click the run button to my program you'll be directed to a 

### Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did? i loved coming up with logic for this game. It interested me knowing that I could turn a simple game that play face to face into a computer game. 
- I wanted to make it visually appealing and make features that made the game simple and easy for anyone to play wether you are a beginner or are familiar with the game. 
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?  My final project follows pretty well with my intial design. The only differences are that I was able to add more features to the game making it more user friendly. I didn't plan to do that in the beginning but it made more and more sense to do that as i moved forward.
- What did you learn from this process?  
- What was the hardest part of the final project? The hardest part of the final project for me was working with the frontend part of my game. I haven't spent a lot of time making a user interface but with the help of my TA's and friends I was able to get connected to the right resources to help me complete my project. 
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now? 
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
