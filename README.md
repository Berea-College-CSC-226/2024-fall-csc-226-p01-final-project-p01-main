# ‚ùóCSC226 Final Project

## Instructions

‚ùóÔ∏èExclamation Marks ‚ùóÔ∏èindicate action items; you should remove these emoji as you complete/update the items which 
  they accompany. (This means that your final README should have no ‚ùóÔ∏èin it!)

## References 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.


Dr Heggens: for overall layout, gave me ideas on how my layout should look like
ChatGPT: used it to help fix the code for my falling ball issue. I had one ball moving horizontally while moving down, so I used chat to help me fix the code, to where multiple balls are spawned at the top and not just one ball.
Tojo: helped me with the inits and also got my screen to work
pygame documentations: used throughout the game, esp for drawing the objects (player and the red circles)
Nauka: Helped me draw the falling balls on the screen and also with the random radiants (I needed the random radiants for the falling balls)

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

Ô∏è**Title**: StarFLARE survival

  **Purpose**: my game is going to have asteriods/balls coming down from the screen and the rocket(main piece) is going to have to dodge them, if not you die.

Ô∏è**Source Assignment(s)**: T11: The Legend of Tuna: Breath of Catnip
                             T12: Events and GUIs

Ô∏è**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Don't leave me in your README!](image/crc.png ![img_1.png](img_1.png) ")


Ô∏è**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: parn
    Branch 2 name: _____________
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    I feel like I am behind, I was waiting on feedback from milestone 1, and after getting the feedback, I realized that I needed to basically change my outline. The Dodgeball class is suppose to be the GUI class. And most of the methods inside the previous Dodgeball class are suppose
    to be inside the GUI class. And I thought I wouldn't need to create a player class, I thought that would be covered inside either the GUI class or the Dodgeball class. But now I feel a little lost on with methods are suppose to be in which class and what their attributes are going to be.
    I am worried that, I am going to get more lost as I continue to work on this project. Even after asking for help, I feel like once I go back and work on the project by my self, I would get lost too often which sets me back a lot. When I get lost, I tend to shut down or I take a break which 
    can sometimes go longer than expected. I am also scared that when I go to the TAs or the prof for help, I won't be able to explain what problems I am having in a way that I want them to understand. When I get stuck on a problem on something I don't really understand myself, I don't know how 
    to ask proper help. But hopefully I make a lot of progress during Thanksgiving break. 
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

  **Completion Percentage**: 55% done

Ô∏è**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    At the beginning of the project, I felt confident and I set the bar a bit too high for myself. I think my confidence is decreasing as we approach the deadline because of my progress. When we do progress check in class, I feel so behind. A lot of people are above 50% before milestone 3
    but I just now passed my 50% mark and I feel very behind compared to my classmates. To complete this project on time, instead of being stuck by myself, if I take more than a day to fix a bug and I still can't do it, I go to TA hours now. Because the deadline is approaching, I am trying to 
    manage my time well and get the help while I still can. When I go to TA hours and they explain me codes, when I go back to my dorm, I like to go through it to make sure I actually understand. By doing this I feel like I can finish on time.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
In my game, you have falling red balls (dodgeballs), and the rocket (green block). The goal is to avoid the falling red balls as long as you can. The rocket can only move left or right.
When the user hits run, you will use the left or right keys on the laptop to move the rocket around to avoid collision between the red falling balls and the rocket. A timer is present in
the top left corner of the screen, this is to see how long yoy lasted.


### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
