## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `Berea Registration System`

**Purpose**: `Use a web interface to sign up for courses, backed with Flask framework`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `
    - Dictionaries (RQ12)
    - Classes and Objects (RQ14)
    - Lists (RQ10)
    - Selection (RQ7)
    - Iteration (RQ8)
    - Functions (RQ5 and RQ4)
`

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
[Don't leave me in your README!](image/crc.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one. ")

**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: kitazb
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    I did a lot of work in the database handling, and tests. I was a little behind, but I made it up in the next
    weeks. I am worried about the tests and how to integrate them with the database. I am hopeful that I will be 
    able to handle the many to many relationship model in a good way, and also handle the requests and responses 
    accordingly. 
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

`70%`

**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
I feel really confident. Most of the tasks are done, and I only need to clean the code, and add a few 
things for the request and response handling, along with some testing. 
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

Program description
It is a registration system, where you select your name, as a student, to open your page, view your current
courses (if any), and to add new courses. After you add a course through the crn (which you should find
in the database), you should also type your PIN, which you will get from your professor. Once done and everything
is correct, the course will be added to the database and you will receive a confirmation page.


Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.


In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?

I selected this project as I was a interested in web development, and I found it a way to learn more
about CURD operations between the request-response cycle and databases. The initial design was similar
to the final. However, there has been a lot of changes, especially in testing methods. 

As I progressed in the project, I learned many things about databases, Flask, and many-to-many relationships. It was
definitly challenging to link the tables together, and also to test the bases without affecting the rows.
This was the hardest part in the design. 

Next time, I will start working on the connection side (Flask) before the database, to ensure that my design
is sending and receiving the correct data so it does not affect the database badly.
