## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

Ô∏è**Title**: `Library Catalog`

Ô∏è**Source Assignment(s)**: `I am basing this project off of T12`

Ô∏è**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Library Catalog](LibraryCatalog_CRC_Card-c.png "LibraryCatalog")
![Library App](LibraryApp_CRC_Card-a.png "LibraryApp")
![Book](Book_CRC_Card-b.png "Book")



‚ùóÔ∏è**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: pokitkog
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    I am a bit lost and feeling behind but am looking at tutorials for sqlite and figuring out how to use it now. I am worried
    about implementing it wrong or not having enough time to add all the features I want, but I am going to take this one step
    at a time. I do have a vision of what I want to do from here so I am a bit more focused than first week. I imported sqlite
    this week and looked into how to use it which is a great first step.
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

‚ùóÔ∏è**Completion Percentage**: `70%`

‚ùóÔ∏è**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
   I do not feel confident at all in completing this project because I feel like I am still very bad at coding and new
   to using sqlite in order to create a database. To increase the likelihood to be more successful in completing this project
   before the due date, I want to visit lab hours and consider spending some time educating myself further on sqlite through
   tutorials and practice (creating separate branch!).
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 



### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
